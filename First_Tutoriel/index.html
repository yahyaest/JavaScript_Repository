    <h3>How Can Inflation Impact Your Savings?</h3>

    <p>
      Over time, inflation can reduce the value of your savings, because prices
      typically go up in the future. This is most noticeable with cash. If you
      keep $10,000 under your bed, that money may not be able to buy as much 20
      years into the future.<br />
      While you haven't actually lost money, you end up with a smaller net worth
      because inflation eats into your purchasing power.
    </p>
